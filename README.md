# Snake-Water-Gun-Game
A simple Python CLI game based on the classic Snake 🐍, Water 💧, Gun 🔫 concept. The user plays against the computer, which picks a random move. Clear win/draw/lose logic is implemented with real-time user input. Fun mini-project to practice basic Python, conditionals, and random module!
